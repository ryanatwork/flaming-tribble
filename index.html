          <p class="lead">Using our Los Angeles area restaurants, Big Wangs and the U.S.M.C have worked cooperatively with annual toy drives for
          the past several years. We are excited to present this tournament in conjunction with the U.S.M.C and give back to the underprivileged
          children in our communities. Big Wangs, the premiere Sports Restaurants of Los Angeles, has a history of supporting our troops and their
          families. This is why we have joined together once again, with the U.S.M.C, and their amazing Toys for Tots event, and decided to host the 3rd Tots
          Charity Golf Tournament. This great day on the course should provide fun times for our supporters and customers, as well as, assisting the
          Marines giving needy children gifts during the holiday season. In conjunction with this event, each Big Wangs location will also serve as a toy
          annual Big Wangs/Toys for drop off site during the holiday season for Toys for Tots.</p>

          <p class="lead">Even though Toys for Tots will be receiving a portion of the proceeds, each participant is asked to bring in an unwrapped (but new)
          toy with a value of at least $10.00. We will be joined by the Marine Corps Color Guard and many Marine Corp recruiters (don't worry they will not
          be there for you to join) who the raffles.</p>

          <p class="lead">There will be a Breakfast Station which will consist of bagels and muffins, as well as, coffee, tea and orange juice.
          For the players who need a pick me up, there will also be a Bloody Mary Bar provided. Lunch will be provided on the course also. The tournament
          will be followed with an Awards Reception at inside the clubhouse (Cash Bar). Please join us on the course and help us give back to the
          children in our city during this upcoming holiday season.</p>
